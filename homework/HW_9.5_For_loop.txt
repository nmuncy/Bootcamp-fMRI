### Example loops


1) loop through list

	for i in this that these; do
		echo $i
	done


2) loop through same list as (1) but using brackets

	for j in th{is,at,ese}; do
		echo $j
	done


3) loop through many numbers

	for a in {1..10}; do
		echo $a
	done


4) loop through list of combined brackets expanded

	for k in {A..G}{M..Z}; do
		echo $k
	done


5) another example

	for b in start_{1..6}{a..d}_finish; do 
		echo $b
	done
